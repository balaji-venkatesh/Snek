This was mainly a project for a computer science class. It is not a condition for regular play; there are many bugs and running glitches. Also it slows down considerably on slower computers due to the large number of calculations made on each game tick.

If this were to be released as an actual game, these would be the changes that would need to be made:

- Use an actual game engine
  - or fix (completely rewrite) the existing "game engine"
- Not use Java
  - Probably needs to be online, using Javascript if it will be successful at all
- Have a proper keybinding system
- Be more extensible to allow more than 2 players, custom enemy AI, etc.
