- I think so?

## Recursive methods
- the Snek.add() method

## Method Overloading
- the Snek.add() method
- the Text() constructor
- the Box() constructor

## Method Overriding
- the Text.getPixels() method (overriding PixelComponent.getPixels())
- the Box.getPixels() method (overriding PixelComponent.getPixels())
- the Grid.getPixels() method (overriding PixelComponent.getPixels())

## Method Overriding
- Text extends PixelComponent
- Box extends PixelComponent
- Grid extends PixelComponent

## ADT / DS
- the Snek has an arraylist
- priority queue for timing actions in Clock
- HashMap for settings & keybindings

## Engine.java
- fully functional pixel game engine
- scales to window size while retaining integral integrity of the pixels
- FANCY BORDER OF DARK GRAYNESS : )

## Keyboard.java
- fully functional keybinding system
